Problem: There are times when people want to watch a movie suddenly. 
To do that, first they have to open the map and search for a cinema nearby.
After that they have to check the movie schedule of each cinema nearby and this is a very troublesome work and takes time.
Thus, our team decided to make a solution.

Objective: Let the user select the movie they want to watch and suggest the fastest way to watch the movie.
This will be done by calculating the distance between the user and the cinema but also by checking the screening time of several cinemas
nearby the user using location-based service from map api and cinema screening time api.
